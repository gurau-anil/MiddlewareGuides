# Understanding Middleware in ASP.NET Core

Web applications can quickly become a mess, especially when handling repetitive tasks like user authentication, logging, and error management for every request. Fortunately, .NET's middleware offers a structured solution to these challenges.

## The Basics of ASP.NET Core Middleware

Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a building block of the HTTP request pipeline. But what exactly is the HTTP request pipeline?

Imagine a series of interconnected stations, each performing a specific task. When a user sends a request to your ASP.NET Core web application, it doesn't immediately reach your application's core logic. Instead, it enters this pipeline. Each station in the pipeline, or each middleware component, has the opportunity to inspect, modify, or even short-circuit the request.
